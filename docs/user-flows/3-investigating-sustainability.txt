3. Investigating a Sustainability Issue

Objective: Enable users to analyze and investigate sustainability metrics and trends.

Investigation Flow:
1. User notices metric anomaly (e.g., drop in aluminum recycling rates)
2. Navigation to Sustainability Analytics → Real-Time Metrics
3. Apply Filters:
   - Material: Aluminum
   - Region: Midwest
